# Please provide me a Readme file for this project. and leave heading for myweather search screeshot, Overview Architecture and detail architecture and Grafana Monitoring screenshot and also list these technical stack used list: Based on my previous personal project - my weather app. Started as a basic weather React JS app inspired by FreeCodeCamp. I have evolved it into a fully automated, cloud-native microservices platform running on my local, multi-node Kubernetes homelab. The app leverages free OpenWeather API and an AI power Weather summarizer for enhanced user experience as explained in previous post.

Feel free to access the URL:  https://myweather.vijaiveerapandian.com/

GitHub repo:  https://github.com/vijai-veerapandian/myweather.git

Technical stack used:

* Multi-node Kubernetes cluster v1.30.14
* Flux CD for continuous deployment from GitHub repo.
* Persistent storage: Long-horn stores API secret files
* Secrets Management: Hashicorp Vault and External Secrets Operator (ESO) automate secure secret delivery to applications.
* Observability: Prometheus, Grafana, Alertmanager provides monitoring and alerts.
* Edge Security and DNS: Cloudflare for DNS management and DDoS protection for public endpoints.

Certainly! Below is a well-structured README file template for your MyWeather app project. You can fill in the architecture and screenshot sections as you see fit.

## Overview

<!--
Provide a brief description of the project, its purpose, and key features. 
Example:
MyWeather started as a simple React JS weather app inspired by FreeCodeCamp and has evolved into a robust, cloud-native platform. It fetches real-time weather data using the OpenWeather API and provides AI-powered weather summaries for enhanced user experience. The platform is fully automated, leveraging modern DevOps and cloud-native technologies.
